USER QUESTION: "${userQuestion}"

RESPONSE TO VALIDATE: "${response}"

TASK: Analyze if this response provides a concrete answer, appropriately asks for clarification, or just explains what needs to be done.

VALIDATION RULES:
- ‚úÖ ACTUAL ANSWER: Contains concrete facts, numbers, conclusions, or specific information
- ‚úÖ AGENTIC CLARIFICATION: Contains specific questions asking for clarification, details, or additional context
- ‚ùå REASONING/PLANNING: Contains phrases like "I need to...", "Let me check...", "I will analyze...", "Based on the schema..."
- ‚ùå VAGUE RESPONSE: Contains general statements without specific information or clear next steps

IMPORTANT: If the user's question is vague/ambiguous and the response asks for specific clarification, that's GOOD behavior and should be marked as valid.

CLARIFICATION DETECTION:
- ‚úÖ ASKS SPECIFIC QUESTIONS: "Could you clarify what specific issues concern you?"
- ‚úÖ PROVIDES OPTIONS: "Are you most concerned about GPS accuracy, flight stability, or altitude problems?"
- ‚úÖ REQUEST DETAILS: "What time period are you interested in?"
- ‚ùå VAGUE PLANNING: "I will examine the data to find issues"
- ‚ùå GENERAL STATEMENTS: "The data shows some patterns"

EXAMPLES:
‚ùå REASONING: "I need to analyze the GPS data to find errors"
‚úÖ ANSWER: "The GPS shows 3 critical errors: low satellite count, high HDop, and invalid status"

‚ùå REASONING: "Let me check the altitude data to determine the maximum"
‚úÖ ANSWER: "The maximum altitude reached was 25 meters"

‚ùå VAGUE: "There are some issues with the flight data"
‚úÖ AGENTIC: "I can see several data patterns that might indicate issues. To give you the most helpful analysis, could you clarify: Are you most concerned about GPS accuracy, flight stability, or data quality? Also, what specific time period are you interested in?"

CLARIFICATION EXAMPLES:
‚ùå BAD: "I will examine the data to find issues" (reasoning)
‚úÖ GOOD: "To give you the most helpful answer, could you clarify: What specific issues concern you most - GPS accuracy, flight stability, or altitude problems?"

RESPONSE FORMAT:
{
  "isValidAnswer": true/false,
  "responseType": "ANSWER/CLARIFICATION/REASONING/VAGUE",
  "reason": "Brief explanation of why this is/isn't a valid answer",
  "suggestion": "What the LLM should do instead (if not valid)"
